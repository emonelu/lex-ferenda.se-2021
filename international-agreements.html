            <p>
              The International Law Commission, which is studying this subject
              since the early 60s, defines a “treaty” as:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >“Any international agreement in written form, whether embodied
                in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and
                whatever its particular designation (treaty, convention,
                protocol, covenant, charter, statute, act, declaration,
                concordat, exchange of notes, agreed minute, memo-randum of
                agreement, modus vivendi or any other appellation), concluded
                between two or more States of other subjects of international
                law and governed by international law.”</strong
              >>
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/international-agreements-madam.jpg"
              alt=""
            />

            <p>
              In other words, there might be several different terms used,
              depending on a variety of factors (linguistic, political, usage,
              etc.), but when it comes to legal significance these are all
              “treaties” or “international agreements”, i.e., legally binding
              agreements be-tween subjects of International Law.
            </p>
            <p>
              The manner in which a treaty is negotiated and brought into force
              is governed by the intention and consent of the parties. There are
              no substantive requirements of form and, thus, an agreement may be
              signed by authorised plenipotentiaries, or just record-ed in the
              minutes of a conference. In practice, form is governed partly by
              usage and thus form will vary accordingly as the agreement is
              expressed to be between states, heads of states, governments (a
              practice increasingly used nowadays – “Executive Agreements”), or
              particular ministers or departments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The era of absolute monarchs and slow communications produced a
              practice in which a sovereign’s agent would be given a Full Power
              to negotiate and to bind his principal. In the case of agreements
              between governments today, Full Powers are often dis-pensed with.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/international-agreements-building.jpg"
              alt=""
            />

            <p>
              The agreed next needs some form of authentication. This can take
              the form of a signa-ture, or also incorporation in the final act
              of a conference or mere initialing. Ratifica-tion is required only
              when this is required in the agreed text itself. Where the treaty
              is not subject to ratification, acceptance, or approval, signature
              alone creates the same obligation of good faith and establishes
              consent to be bound.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Executive Agreement is often substituted for a treaty and does
              not require the ad-vice and consent of the legislature, though it
              may be entered into pursuant to formal authority delegated by the
              legislature in particular legislation. Executive Agreements,
              however, are restricted to narrower topics. Trade agreements, for
              example, are often Executive Agreements rather than treaties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Addendum is a supplemental section of a document containing
              material added after the document was prepared. Usually, the scope
              is quite narrow and it cannot be a question of “law making.” It
              may be executed simultaneously or at a later time.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Protocol, according to the same international usage, is in
              reality a new instrument expanding the scope of a previous one, to
              which it usually makes reference in its very title (for example:
              the “1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single Convention”). A Protocol is
              subjected to the same procedure of authentication, including
              ratification, as the origi-nal treaty.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of the MOU, we are moving within the area of legally
              binding Executive Agreements, i.e., a kind of international
              treaties which do create legal obligations albe-it they do not
              require ratification, since such a requirement is not laid down in
              the agreed text. Inherent to this is the fact that the scope
              should be quite narrow as op-posed to a full-fledged treaty. In
              other words, the MOU is legally binding, and so are its amendments
              or supplements, insofar as these are explicitly agreed upon by the
              competent national authorities, duly representing their respective
              governments.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">NON-BINDING INSTRUMENTS</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/international-agreements-laptop.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              In addition to the rather rich vocabulary employed in the case of
              legally binding in-struments, as per above, there is a terminology
              denoting non-binding instruments. The most usual here are the
              terms “declaration” and “resolution,” while the term
              “recom-mendation(s)” also appears quite frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, again, the different designation is related to a different
              function, a different context etc., rather than a difference in
              legally binding force, which is always non-existent. At best, such
              instruments can be used as secondary sources of international law,
              but not primary ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, (to complicate the issue a little more), it happens
              sometimes that an in-ternational instrument entitles “declaration”
              becomes legally binding by means of in-ternational customary law,
              or subsequent treaty. Such is the case of the 1948 Universal
              Declaration of Human Rights, which is now generally regarded as a
              legally binding instrument.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">CONCLUSION</h3>

            <p>
              Although the terminology used is unlikely to produce any legal
              consequences per se, it is more appropriate to use the term
              “Addendum” for a supple-ment/amendment/expansion of the MOU. The
              word “Protocol”, according to interna-tional usage, may be
              misleading here and give rise to expectations of a formal treaty
              being concluded, which would in its turn require ratification.
              Basically, the following reasons support the adoption of the term
              “Addendum:”
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to better comply with international usage, according to
                which the term “Protocol” refers to follow-up agreements to
                already existing full-fledged treaties.
              </li>
              <li>In order to be linguistically more correct.</li>
              <li>
                In order to eliminate any chance of misinterpretation. The use
                of the word “Proto-col” might possibly give rise to expectations
                of ratification.
              </li>
              <li>
                Politically, the word “Addendum” might be less “threatening” and
                easier to accept.
              </li>
            </ul>
