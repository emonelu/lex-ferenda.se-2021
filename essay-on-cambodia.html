          <p>
            There is something about Cambodia, which has captured my imagination
            and mobi-lised my capacity to feel sympathy and concern. I have only
            been one year in the country and my knowledge of the language is
            extremely basic, but I have done quite a lot of thinking and tried
            to be as observant as possible. I now feel, prematurely as it may
            be, that I want to put down in writing some of my thoughts about the
            country and its people. Just for the record.
          </p>

          <p>
            Exactly because I feel committed, I take the liberty to be frank
            wherever my com-ments are not flattering. I prefer to call a spade a
            spade even if it amounts to unortho-dox or politically incorrect
            statements; it will be, of course, up to the reader to appre-ciate
            them.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Some Historical Remarks</h2>
          <p>
            The name Cambodia (in Khmer: Kampuchea; older pronunciation:
            Kambuja) is of In-dian origin, as is much of Cambodian culture. It
            means descendants (or sons) of (Prince) Kambu. According to
            Cambodian mythology, one of the sons of Prince Kambu from Southern
            India, fleeing internal rivalries at home, emigrated eastwards and
            landed on an island where the mythical creatures (half-humans and
            half-snakes) called Naga lived. There, he married princess Maera,
            daughter of the Naga King, and so was the Cambodian dynasty born.
            Later on a miracle took place, and the island of Naga (an island by
            the same name still exists, near the coast of Sihanoukville)
            expand-ed and became a whole country, Cambodia. A combination of the
            names Kambu and Maera (K + Maer) gives the word Aekmr (= Kmaer),
            which is the name of the peo-ple of Cambodia. (Do not at this point
            look for logic in the sequence of the letters of this word in the
            Khmer script…)
          </p>
          <p>
            This myth seems to reflect some historical reality. Cambodians did
            receive a number of “civilising missions” from India. Cambodian
            religion (first Hin-duism and, later on, Buddhism) originates from
            the same source, and much of the Khmer vocabulary stems from
            Sanskrit and Pali. The Khmer script originates from Southern India
            too, and Indian traits are discernible in archi-tecture, music,
            dance, food and in the features of many Cambodians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first historical information on Cambodian society is found in
            Chinese sources, which talk about two (Cambodian) kingdoms in the
            first centuries AD, the kingdom of Chenla in the North and that of
            Phunan (probably a Chinese distortion of Phnom, which means
            mountain) in the South. These two kingdoms merged to form the great
            Empire of Angkor, called so be-cause of the name of its capital.
            Angkor, the oldest and the greatest Empire of South East Asia,
            flourished between the 8th and the 13th century AD. Its borders
            included much of contemporary Thailand, Laos, Southern Vietnam, and
            reached until Burma. Angkorian civilisation influenced the Thai, the
            Laotians and the Burmese in many ways, including the script. The
            great complex of temples known as Angkor Wat, one of the biggest in
            the World, originates from that period.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the 14th century the Empire gradually declined. It was
            attacked first by Champa and then by the Vietnamese and the Thai.
            The situation be-came far more serious by fierce rivalries within
            the royal family. Rivals used to make alliances with either Vietnam
            or Thailand, each time giving away substantial portions of Cambodian
            territory in exchange for support in their internal power struggles.
            This peculiar trait of Cambodian history is still haunting the
            country until today...
          </p>
          <p>
            Ironically, what saved Cambodia from being devoured by her
            neighbours was French colonisation, which lasted from 1864 until
            1953. That year, King Norodom Sihanouk orchestrated a masterly
            planned international campaign, which left the French no option but
            to recognise Cambodian in-dependence. Cambodia’s Odyssey since then
            seems to follow the personal Odyssey of Sihanouk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only one year after independence, Sihanouk abdicated from the throne
            in favour of his father, Norodom Suramarit, and became a politician.
            He formed his own political party , which advocated some kind of
            Buddhist Socialism, and won all the seats in the Parliament!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sihanouk ruled Cambodia until 1970. As a ruler he was authoritarian
            and in-tolerant of dissent, but at the same time unbelievably
            popular. As a politi-cian he was shrewd and possessed an astute
            judgement, but also very errat-ic, except on one point, the survival
            of his country. He developed to perfec-tion a technique of
            calculated unpredictability and became the master of playing the
            enemies of Cambodia against each other. He went to great lengths to
            keep the Vietnam war away from Cambodia but failed. The Vi-etcong
            were supplying the FNL in South Vietnam through Khmer territory,
            which led the Americans to bomb Cambodia. Finally, Sihanouk was
            over-thrown in 1970 (while on a trip abroad) by pro-American general
            Lon Nol.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Lon Nol years (1970 - 1975) Cambodia was overwhelmed by
            rampant corruption, incompetence, Communist insurrection and
            escalation of the American bombings.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 1975 was a significant month in Indochina: the Cambodian
            Com-munists (Les Khmeres Rouges, as Sihanouk nicknamed them in the
            60:s) took Phnom Penh on 17 April, while on 30 April the Vietcong
            captured Sai-gon. The Americans fled in panic from both countries.
            The Khmeres Roug-es, under the mysterious Pol Pot, declared 1975 as
            Year Zero and ruled until January 1979. That year the country was
            invaded by Vietnam, which liber-ated Cambodia from Pol Pot’s
            murderous rule but, “in exchange”, installed a friendly regime and
            kept its troops in the country until 1989, thus causing deep
            resentment to the Cambodian people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rule of the Khmers Rouges was truly totalitarian and far more
            brutal than its model, which was the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
            All cities were evacuated, money was abolished, religion was
            prohibited, temples were de-stroyed, travels and communications
            prohibited, all professionals and intel-lectuals exterminated,
            family was dissolved and approx. 2 million Cambo-dians (out of a
            total of 7-8 million, at the time) died. It was even prohibited to
            own kitchen utensils, to make food at home, or to wear any other
            kind of clothes than black pyjamas, similar to those used by Chinese
            peasants.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 1979 until 1991 Cambodia was ruled by the pro-Vietnamese
            Com-munist Government of Hun Sen and Heng Samrin. In the meantime,
            Sihan-ouk was living in exile in Peking and in Pyongyang, as the
            nominal Head of the anti-Vietnamese resistance, which included the
            Khmeres Rouges! Pol Pot launched a guerrilla war from the jungle,
            which in a sense continues un-til this time albeit in insignificant
            scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1991 the United Nations finally managed to hold a Peace
            Conference in Paris, as an outcome of which Cambodia was placed
            under the authority of a special UN organ, the UNTAC (United Nations
            Transitional Authority for Cambodia). In 1993 the first democratic
            elections were held, which were won by the Sihanoukist party
            FUNCINPEC, led by Prince Ranariddh (son of Sihanouk). Hun Sen’s
            party, the CPP, came second, but refused to cede power. Sihanouk,
            who in the meantime became King again, “solved” the problem by
            requesting both parties (and even the small Buddhist Liberal Party)
            to form a coalition Government. Thus, Cambodia today has a
            plural-ist democracy but practically no opposition, since all major
            parties are in the Government. Appropriately (and in line with
            ancient Khmer traditions), the only form of opposition is that of
            fierce rivalries within the Royal Govern-ment.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Geography of Cambodia</h2>
          <p>
            Apart from history and culture, the myth of Naga also reflects the
            geographical reali-ties of Cambodia: the central plains of the
            country were covered by the sea in prehis-toric times. Even today,
            the level of these plains is so low, that they get easily flooded
            during the rains.
          </p>
          <p>
            These plains are surrounded by mountains. At the centre there is a
            big lake, the Tonle Sap, which is linked with the Mekong by the
            Tonle Sap river. During the rains (June - October) the flow of this
            river is reversed, which is a unique phenomenon, and the size of the
            lake doubles. The lake and the surrounding plains is the food basket
            of Cambo-dia and the area where most Khmers live. The mountains are
            either covered by impen-etrable jungle or inhabited by hill tribes.
            Even the coast is not a favourable abode for the almost exclusively
            rice-farming Khmers: there is hardly any significant city there.
            Sihanoukville (renamed Kompong Som during the Lon Nol regime) was
            built by Si-hanouk in the 60:s to serve as a port, but a visit to
            the town convinces that the Khmers are not a seafaring nation: the
            town faces the inland and not the coast. In fact, the sea is totally
            invisible from downtown Sihanoukville!
          </p>
          <p>
            Cambodia is at its best in places like Pursat or Battambang (the
            country’s second larg-est city): semi-rural towns located in
            beautiful fertile plains, and built along rivers leading to Tonle
            Sap. The only truly urban environment is Phnom Penh, which is
            per-haps the prettiest city built by the French in Indochina. Today
            Phnom Penh is slowly recovering after all the blows of the recent
            past. Parts of it do reveal the city’s old charm, but a lot of
            investment and effort is needed to upgrade its dilapidated
            infra-structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is accessible of the Cambodian landscape, i.e., the central
            plains and the coast, is beautiful and pleasant but not
            breathtaking. I personally find the landscape of Malay-sia and
            Indonesia more scenic. The mountains do offer some capturing views,
            but they are mostly inaccessible.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Political Situation</h2>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cambodia-politics-bg.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            After so many years of warfare, Cambodia is now struggling against
            the odds to achieve real democracy. The difficulties are many: civil
            society is weak, corruption is all pervasive, the legal system is
            destroyed, and, above all, Cambodian civilisation does not favour
            pluralism and individual freedom, neither does it provide paradigms
            of sound and unselfish leadership. Intrigues, intimidation and even
            political assassina-tions are not uncommon, while some of the
            politicians, notably those affiliated with the CPP, seem to be
            inspired by the authoritarian style of Mahathir (Malaysia), Lee Quan
            Yew (Singapore), or Souharto (Indonesia), all of whom dismiss Human
            Rights as “Western” and, thus, unfit for Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there is freedom of expression, many politicians are not
            used to public criti-cism and react harshly. Journalists, for that
            matter, are not used to free speech either and many of their
            newspapers can only qualify as yellow press. The absence of any
            significant tradition in writing and reading does not make things
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional problem is that the “co-governance” of Ranariddh
            (FUNCINPEC) and Hun Sen (CPP) is far from smooth. According to
            Sihanouk’s original idea, both these gentlemen are Prime Ministers,
            and all the important ministries have two co-Ministers, one from
            each party. However, instead of co-operating, the two parties seem
            to sabo-tage each other, while from time to time the conflicts
            become open. The army is divid-ed along party lines and skirmishes
            between the two groups have occurred. Be it as it may, however,
            Cambodia might already at this stage qualify as the most liberal and
            democratic country in the region of South East Asia (with the
            possible exception of the Philippines).
          </p>
          <p>
            The next elections are anticipated for 1998. Many scenaria have been
            projected as to what is going to happen. Much depends on the
            personal fate of the actors involved, namely Sihanouk, Ranariddh,
            Hun Sen, Chia Sim (CPP Chairman) and Sar Kheng (CPP emerging
            contender to Hun Sen’s position). However, if there is no change in
            the individual set-up, the chances are high that the two parties
            will be in coalition again. In Cambodia the only thing that matters
            is position and power; thus, if the coa-lition splits, the losers of
            the elections will have to relinquish power, the mere thought of
            which is a nightmare. It appears, therefore, that Cambodia, for yet
            some time to come, will not be ready to accommodate real opposition.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>“Comme il est mignon cet petit!”</em> exclaimed the wife of the
            French Governor when she first met 19-year old Prince Norodom
            Sihanouk in the early 40:s. The French wanted a docile King for
            their Cambodian protectorate. They were not satisfied with an
            already pliant Sisowath Monivong, Sihanouk’s predecessor; they
            wanted somebody even more obedient, who would only care for the
            Royal Ballet and nothing else. They thought that this mignon boy
            with a high-pitched voice would be what they wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            How wrong they were! As we saw earlier, Sihanouk was the one to
            achieve the inde-pendence of Cambodia and, in many ways, this
            independence has been synonymous with his name ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sihanouk is the personification of charisma and a great political
            mind. <em>Samdech Euw,</em> as Cambodians call him, is indeed a very
            unique person and, because of his position, Cambodian culture allows
            (in fact, expects) him to be unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a playboy (he claims that since he won the heart of Queen
            Monique, he opted for monogamic life), Sihanouk is also a gourmet, a
            bon-vivant, a saxophonist, a com-poser, an author, an actor, a film
            director and many other things. A fascinating person-ality, he has
            the tremendous capacity to inspire confidence. Many World leaders
            who have met him have treated him not only as a statesman, but as a
            personal friend. It was thanks to such bonds of friendship that he
            has survived the one crisis after the other. For example, when the
            Khmeres Rouges kept him under house arrest from 1976 to 1979 (and
            killed six of his children), it was at the personal insistence of
            Tsou En Lai that Pol Pot spared his life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sihanouk has definitely been modern Cambodia’s greatest asset, but
            also a liability: like so many leaders of his stature, he opted for
            personal rule and never wanted to cre-ate anything greater than
            himself. Thus, he never really tried to give Cambodia sound
            institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sihanouk is for Cambodia the equivalent of Olof Palme in Sweden, and
            much more. Cambodians adore him. The day he passes away, Cambodia
            will no longer be the same. Just like Sweden: it is no longer the
            same country since Olof Palme was assassi-nated.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Personalities: Saloth Sar (Pol Pot)</h2>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/pol-pot-bg.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            When the Khmers Rouges took Phnom Penh in 1975, nobody knew who was
            their leader. It was only after one and a half year that the name of
            the Prime Minister was disclosed: <em>Pol Pot.</em> Nobody had ever
            heard of him. However, when his picture was published, his own
            family were surprised to see that he was their own
            <em>Saloth Sar,</em> which is his real name. He had disappeared
            without trace many years ago, having gone to the jungle to join the
            guerrillas. When Phnom Penh was taken by the Khmeres Rouges, Pol Pot
            did not join his men in their triumphant parade into the capital.
            In-stead, he arrived secretly, several days later, when the city was
            almost completely evacuated...
          </p>
          <p>
            Very little is known about Pol Pot. He himself admitted that he was
            Saloth Sar only in 1979, after his fall, while on a trip to China.
            On the same occasion he also admitted the existence of the Cambodian
            Communist Party, until then held secret (the people only knew of a
            mysterious Revolutionary Organisation - <em>Angka Padevat </em> and
            of <em>Brother No. 1</em>). It seems, that during his years in
            power, Pol Pot eradicated all information about his personal life.
            His public appearances were extremely few and he never became the
            ob-ject of a personal cult, like other Communist leaders. Total
            secrecy appears to be the motto of his life. Those few, who have met
            him, say that he is a handsome and soft spoken man, polite, sensuous
            and convincing. He gives the impression that he does believe in his
            beliefs, which may be the very se-cret of his success (apart from
            secrecy itself). They all agree that this gentle person could not
            possibly commit such ferocious atrocities, like the genocide of some
            2 mil-lion people. And yet, there is no doubt that he did. All
            Cambodians, in unison, testify about his horrifying crimes, and
            people do not lie collectively!

            It is often said, that you cannot generalise when you talk about an
            entire nation. But in some cases it may be easier than in others. If
            one imagines the notion of <em>personality</em> as a circle, part of
            which is what we call the <em>“national character”</em> while the
            rest is a person’s individual traits; the border between these two
            parts is not the same in all cultures.
            <em>
              In Cambodia, national character is all-pervasive and leaves
              extremely little space for individual variation.</em
            >
            It is as if all Cambodians had identical
            <em>“software” </em> installed in their minds. How else can you
            explain that 10 million Cambodians unex-ceptionably consider plain
            white rice (without even salt) as the quintessence of all cui-sine ?
            If people were allowed to freely develop their own minds, this would
            be unnat-ural, for 10 million people could not possibly have exactly
            the same taste! <em>- Rizomania -</em> is only one example. The
            <em>Software</em> tells everybody what and how to eat , how to hold
            a knife when he peels the onions, how exactly to stretch his legs or
            his arms, what time to go to bed, what time to get up, what to like
            and what to dislike, when and how to get married, what exactly to
            say in a conversation, and many other things. Such natural
            differences among people as being introvert or extrovert, choleric
            or phlegmatic, early sleeper or early riser, are totally eliminated
            by the <em>software!</em> If you meet one Cambodian, you met them
            all! The only real variation is found in people’s looks (you still
            find long and short, fat and thin, beautiful and ugly
            Cambo-dians...), in their capacities (varying degrees of IQ etc.),
            and, to some extent, in their moral qualities (not in their values,
            though).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am inclined to think that the vehicle of this and any other
            mass-software is the lan-guage. Far from merely being a means of
            communication, language, embodies values, thinking, wisdom, and
            “tunes” the minds of the people with a number of “com-mands,” which
            are automatically activated whenever necessary. The Greeks, who
            rec-ognised this already in ancient times, went so far as to define
            their own identity not on the basis of origin, religion, geography,
            or political/administrative bonds, but on the basis of their
            language and its special characteristics as a vehicle of
            civilisation, a sort of human “software.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking these assumptions for granted, I would attempt to commit the
            politically incor-rect offence of formulating some generalisations
            about the Khmer psyche. I would then describe the Cambodians as very
            gentle and sensuous people, friendly, shy, po-lite, and
            accommodating. They would never raise their voice. Their answer to
            every-thing is a “yes” and a smile. Never opinionated. They are too
            eager not to loose face in public, and they consider anger as a
            synonymous to madness. Cambodians would ap-pear to most Westerners
            as genuine conformists, who are not interested in ideas or in
            challenging things but only concerned about their survival. They
            give the impression that they only care about the security that
            money offers and only cherish wealth and power. Other values of
            life, such as love, friendship, Justice, fairness, honour, or
            digni-ty, are very low rated and matter very little.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cambodian minds are tuned to stoically accept all the pressures of a
            strictly hierar-chical society: like in most developing countries,
            social stratification in the form of a pyramid is the most important
            social structure. If you are placed at the bottom of the pyramid,
            the Software tells you that you are nobody. You are not supposed to
            express your feelings or thoughts in public, let alone to ventilate
            your frustration: the Software offers you no legitimate outlet. But
            if you are on the top of the pyramid, you are con-sidered ipso facto
            as more handsome, more intelligent, and more capable than others,
            you have better rights than others, and you are even allowed to be a
            person and to ex-press your feelings, including your anger...
          </p>
          <p>
            This suffocatingly stereotype and collectivist Weltanschauung may be
            the very reason to the paradox, that Cambodia alone in all Indochina
            possesses such an impressive ar-ray of characters at the top of its
            society: those few who manage to withstand the enormous pressure of
            totalitarian collectivism must be gifted with extremely strong
            personalities. Alas, they are often so terribly strong that they
            place narcissist self-interest above anything else in the World.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another very typical 3rd World trait is the role of religion in
            Cambodia. You can never miss the omnipresent Buddhist monks:
            practically at any time, they and their pious followers organise
            never ending rituals, processions, festivals, and the like. The sad
            part of it is the “noise pollution” that they produce (the
            motorcycles of Greece are the only serious competitor!). Buddhist
            rituals could indeed be beautiful if it were not for all blaring
            loudspeakers tuned to the maximum volume and yelling on the most
            unpredictable occasions. In Islamic countries, by comparison, the
            loudspeakers are turned on at fixed hours, which render them a
            little more bearable...
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who believe that Buddhism is a philosophical religion,
            Cambodia could be a disappointment. Popular belief among Khmers is a
            mixture of ghost stories, supersti-tion and “magic”. One Judge told
            me, that in case I was attacked by a robber, I should recite a
            ritual phrase seven times, after which, as he insisted, the robber
            would run away. This approach to life seriously competes with
            rational thinking, which is slowly being introduced in Cambodia
            today. People turn to superstition and irrationality to find easy
            answers, instead of doing some thinking (and, why not, producing
            some ideas).
          </p>
          <p>
            To be sure, a nation does dot produce ideas just because its people
            are gifted. My own nation, the Greeks, have overwhelmed the World
            with ideas; and yet, I have never noticed any sign showing that the
            Greeks are more intelligent than others (albeit many of my
            compatriots keep trying hard to impress on foreigners, thus running
            the serious risk of being classified as arrogant idiots…). But ideas
            come from minds, and minds need to be free in order to flourish and
            release their forces. This can only be achieved in individualist
            societies. Collectivist societies, by smashing individual mind, are
            good in producing objects, but not ideas. Have you ever heard of a
            poem composed by a committee?
          </p>
          <p>
            Religion, or rather superstition, along with hierarchy and
            collectivism are in my opin-ion the three most important
            “command.coms” of the Cambodian Software, which is installed in the
            minds of everyone and defines all his functions in detail. Thus,
            like many other cultures in the World, especially in the 3rd World,
            Cambodian is a mass-culture with no room for individual personality.
            The paradigm is that of the flock of sheep, which are all the same,
            all white, and follow each other blindly. Black sheep are not
            tolerated in the flock and must be chased away.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of debate is going on these days on cloning. My experience of
            Cambodians is that their cultural indoctrination is so thorough,
            profound, and efficient, that they can be considered as (mentally)
            cloned for all practical purposes (unless it is a case of very
            advanced collective telepathy) ... I have until now met hundreds, if
            not thousands of Cambodians, and in 100% of the cases exactly the
            same conversation is repeated, per-fectly predictable each single
            time, including the mistake of always taking me for a Hungarian (see
            the reproduced dialogue below)!
          </p>
          <p>
            Lack of individuality may be a typical 3rd World trait, but in
            Cambodia it is enor-mously aggravated by the astonishing fact that
            Cambodians never read books. Thus, their exposure to the World of
            ideas and choices is minimal. Instead, Cambodians are ruled by the
            rigid oral traditions of a rural society, which are embodied in the
            language and simply require everybody to conform and to comply
            rather than to think and to question. As long as Cambodia remains
            the place where there are hardly any bookshops (not even in the
            capital!) and where the sight of a man holding a book in his hands
            and reading it is unknown, mental cloning will be there for a long
            time to come and Cambodia will not be a society of ideas and quality
            of life.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Nature of Khmer Culture</h2>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/khmer-culture-bg.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            As a corollary of the above, there is very little scope for privacy
            in Cambodian society. You notice people searching each other’s bags
            and pockets, and if you happen to talk to somebody in the street,
            several others approach to overhear the conversation (in a very
            indiscrete manner!). If you ask them to go away they fail to
            understand why, and they just stay on, which can be very irritating.
          </p>
          <p>
            The said lack of interest in the written speech is also a very
            disappointing trait of Khmer culture. There is very little
            literature in Khmer. Occasionally you will see somebody reading a
            newspaper, and then you will notice that he reads loudly, as all
            semi-illiterate people usually do. - Well, it is not easy to be very
            literate in Khmer an-yway: the script seems to have been
            intentionally designed in such a way, that only the elite could
            possibly master it. When you read a Khmer text you do not actually
            read, you decipher. Now, add the extra difficulty of joining all
            words together (no space in between), and you will get the
            picture... It would not surprise me, if a special-ist in linguistic
            psychology would suggest some connection between the erratic Khmer
            script and the equally erratic Khmer psyche.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Khmer psyche is not always erratic. On some points it
            is very consistent, and one such point is its profound fixation to
            wealth and power. Khmer thinking is power- rather than
            justice-oriented. Equality of Law, for example, is a very low rated
            value, and it is considered as perfectly normal that “the bold and
            the beautiful” enjoy more rights than others, and that they can buy
            not only cars, houses, wives, or sex, but also justice with their
            money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where does the greatness of the Angkorian civilisation fit in? Well,
            Angkor was cer-tainly a great civilisation, but a Pharaohnic one. A
            civilisation based on the absolute power of the God-King over the
            anonymous masses. It was nothing like the ancient civilisations of
            Europe, which freed the individual. When Pythagoras visited Egypt
            and saw the pyramids, he wanted to know who had built them, but got
            no answer to his query: the Egyptians could not care less about who
            had created the pyramids. Some people made them, it doesn’t matter
            who, the credit goes to the Pharaoh any-way... The same applies to
            Angkor and its magnificent edifices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This heritage of Angkor haunts Cambodia still today. If Cambodia
            wishes to be a democratic society, with justice and equality of Law
            as its leading social values, and a society which produces ideas
            rather than objects, it needs reform. It needs to free the
            individual from all this suffocating imposition of stereotype
            behaviour, this rather un-natural uniformity of thinking, feeling
            and taste, so that also the enormous powers hidden in everyone can
            be released.
            <em
              >In other words, Cambodia needs to enter the 20th century, and to
              be exposed to the outside World, to new ideas and lifestyles.</em
            >
            History shows that no great civilisation can flourish and remain
            great unless it opens itself to such an exchange of ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Angkor is of any value, (apart from the aesthetic value of its
            monuments), it is ex-actly because it shows that the Khmers are
            capable of absorbing new ideas. In the same way as Angkor once
            merged Indian with indigenous Khmer ideas to produce such an array
            of magnificent masterpieces, Cambodia today could absorb modern
            thinking and combine it with whatever is worth preserving from her
            own tradition.
