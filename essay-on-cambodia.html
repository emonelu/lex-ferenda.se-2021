        <p>
          There is something about Cambodia, which has captured my imagination
          and mobi-lised my capacity to feel sympathy and concern. I have only
          been one year in the country and my knowledge of the language is
          extremely basic, but I have done quite a lot of thinking and tried
          to be as observant as possible. I now feel, prematurely as it may
          be, that I want to put down in writing some of my thoughts about the
          country and its people. Just for the record.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exactly because I feel committed, I take the liberty to be frank
          wherever my com-ments are not flattering. I prefer to call a spade a
          spade even if it amounts to unortho-dox or politically incorrect
          statements; it will be, of course, up to the reader to appre-ciate
          them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Some Historical Remarks</h2>
        <p>
          The name Cambodia (in Khmer: Kampuchea; older pronunciation:
          Kambuja) is of In-dian origin, as is much of Cambodian culture. It
          means descendants (or sons) of (Prince) Kambu. According to
          Cambodian mythology, one of the sons of Prince Kambu from Southern
          India, fleeing internal rivalries at home, emigrated eastwards and
          landed on an island where the mythical creatures (half-humans and
          half-snakes) called Naga lived. There, he married princess Maera,
          daughter of the Naga King, and so was the Cambodian dynasty born.
          Later on a miracle took place, and the island of Naga (an island by
          the same name still exists, near the coast of Sihanoukville)
          expand-ed and became a whole country, Cambodia. A combination of the
          names Kambu and Maera (K + Maer) gives the word Aekmr (= Kmaer),
          which is the name of the peo-ple of Cambodia. (Do not at this point
          look for logic in the sequence of the letters of this word in the
          Khmer script…)
        </p>
        <p>
          This myth seems to reflect some historical reality. Cambodians did
          receive a number of “civilising missions” from India. Cambodian
          religion (first Hin-duism and, later on, Buddhism) originates from
          the same source, and much of the Khmer vocabulary stems from
          Sanskrit and Pali. The Khmer script originates from Southern India
          too, and Indian traits are discernible in archi-tecture, music,
          dance, food and in the features of many Cambodians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first historical information on Cambodian society is found in
          Chinese sources, which talk about two (Cambodian) kingdoms in the
          first centuries AD, the kingdom of Chenla in the North and that of
          Phunan (probably a Chinese distortion of Phnom, which means
          mountain) in the South. These two kingdoms merged to form the great
          Empire of Angkor, called so be-cause of the name of its capital.
          Angkor, the oldest and the greatest Empire of South East Asia,
          flourished between the 8th and the 13th century AD. Its borders
          included much of contemporary Thailand, Laos, Southern Vietnam, and
          reached until Burma. Angkorian civilisation influenced the Thai, the
          Laotians and the Burmese in many ways, including the script. The
          great complex of temples known as Angkor Wat, one of the biggest in
          the World, originates from that period.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the 14th century the Empire gradually declined. It was
          attacked first by Champa and then by the Vietnamese and the Thai.
          The situation be-came far more serious by fierce rivalries within
          the royal family. Rivals used to make alliances with either Vietnam
          or Thailand, each time giving away substantial portions of Cambodian
          territory in exchange for support in their internal power struggles.
          This peculiar trait of Cambodian history is still haunting the
          country until today...
        </p>
        <p>
          Ironically, what saved Cambodia from being devoured by her
          neighbours was French colonisation, which lasted from 1864 until
          1953. That year, King Norodom Sihanouk orchestrated a masterly
          planned international campaign, which left the French no option but
          to recognise Cambodian in-dependence. Cambodia’s Odyssey since then
          seems to follow the personal Odyssey of Sihanouk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one year after independence, Sihanouk abdicated from the throne
          in favour of his father, Norodom Suramarit, and became a politician.
          He formed his own political party , which advocated some kind of
          Buddhist Socialism, and won all the seats in the Parliament!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sihanouk ruled Cambodia until 1970. As a ruler he was authoritarian
          and in-tolerant of dissent, but at the same time unbelievably
          popular. As a politi-cian he was shrewd and possessed an astute
          judgement, but also very errat-ic, except on one point, the survival
          of his country. He developed to perfec-tion a technique of
          calculated unpredictability and became the master of playing the
          enemies of Cambodia against each other. He went to great lengths to
          keep the Vietnam war away from Cambodia but failed. The Vi-etcong
          were supplying the FNL in South Vietnam through Khmer territory,
          which led the Americans to bomb Cambodia. Finally, Sihanouk was
          over-thrown in 1970 (while on a trip abroad) by pro-American general
          Lon Nol.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Lon Nol years (1970 - 1975) Cambodia was overwhelmed by
          rampant corruption, incompetence, Communist insurrection and
          escalation of the American bombings.
        </p>
        <p>
          April 1975 was a significant month in Indochina: the Cambodian
          Com-munists (Les Khmeres Rouges, as Sihanouk nicknamed them in the
          60:s) took Phnom Penh on 17 April, while on 30 April the Vietcong
          captured Sai-gon. The Americans fled in panic from both countries.
          The Khmeres Roug-es, under the mysterious Pol Pot, declared 1975 as
          Year Zero and ruled until January 1979. That year the country was
          invaded by Vietnam, which liber-ated Cambodia from Pol Pot’s
          murderous rule but, “in exchange”, installed a friendly regime and
          kept its troops in the country until 1989, thus causing deep
          resentment to the Cambodian people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule of the Khmers Rouges was truly totalitarian and far more
          brutal than its model, which was the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
          All cities were evacuated, money was abolished, religion was
          prohibited, temples were de-stroyed, travels and communications
          prohibited, all professionals and intel-lectuals exterminated,
          family was dissolved and approx. 2 million Cambo-dians (out of a
          total of 7-8 million, at the time) died. It was even prohibited to
          own kitchen utensils, to make food at home, or to wear any other
          kind of clothes than black pyjamas, similar to those used by Chinese
          peasants.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1979 until 1991 Cambodia was ruled by the pro-Vietnamese
          Com-munist Government of Hun Sen and Heng Samrin. In the meantime,
          Sihan-ouk was living in exile in Peking and in Pyongyang, as the
          nominal Head of the anti-Vietnamese resistance, which included the
          Khmeres Rouges! Pol Pot launched a guerrilla war from the jungle,
          which in a sense continues un-til this time albeit in insignificant
          scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1991 the United Nations finally managed to hold a Peace
          Conference in Paris, as an outcome of which Cambodia was placed
          under the authority of a special UN organ, the UNTAC (United Nations
          Transitional Authority for Cambodia). In 1993 the first democratic
          elections were held, which were won by the Sihanoukist party
          FUNCINPEC, led by Prince Ranariddh (son of Sihanouk). Hun Sen’s
          party, the CPP, came second, but refused to cede power. Sihanouk,
          who in the meantime became King again, “solved” the problem by
          requesting both parties (and even the small Buddhist Liberal Party)
          to form a coalition Government. Thus, Cambodia today has a
          plural-ist democracy but practically no opposition, since all major
          parties are in the Government. Appropriately (and in line with
          ancient Khmer traditions), the only form of opposition is that of
          fierce rivalries within the Royal Govern-ment.

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Geography of Cambodia</h2>
        <p>
          Apart from history and culture, the myth of Naga also reflects the
          geographical reali-ties of Cambodia: the central plains of the
          country were covered by the sea in prehis-toric times. Even today,
          the level of these plains is so low, that they get easily flooded
          during the rains.
        </p>
        <p>
          These plains are surrounded by mountains. At the centre there is a
          big lake, the Tonle Sap, which is linked with the Mekong by the
          Tonle Sap river. During the rains (June - October) the flow of this
          river is reversed, which is a unique phenomenon, and the size of the
          lake doubles. The lake and the surrounding plains is the food basket
          of Cambo-dia and the area where most Khmers live. The mountains are
          either covered by impen-etrable jungle or inhabited by hill tribes.
          Even the coast is not a favourable abode for the almost exclusively
          rice-farming Khmers: there is hardly any significant city there.
          Sihanoukville (renamed Kompong Som during the Lon Nol regime) was
          built by Si-hanouk in the 60:s to serve as a port, but a visit to
          the town convinces that the Khmers are not a seafaring nation: the
          town faces the inland and not the coast. In fact, the sea is totally
          invisible from downtown Sihanoukville!
        </p>
        <p>
          Cambodia is at its best in places like Pursat or Battambang (the
          country’s second larg-est city): semi-rural towns located in
          beautiful fertile plains, and built along rivers leading to Tonle
          Sap. The only truly urban environment is Phnom Penh, which is
          per-haps the prettiest city built by the French in Indochina. Today
          Phnom Penh is slowly recovering after all the blows of the recent
          past. Parts of it do reveal the city’s old charm, but a lot of
          investment and effort is needed to upgrade its dilapidated
          infra-structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is accessible of the Cambodian landscape, i.e., the central
          plains and the coast, is beautiful and pleasant but not
          breathtaking. I personally find the landscape of Malay-sia and
          Indonesia more scenic. The mountains do offer some capturing views,
          but they are mostly inaccessible.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Political Situation</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cambodia-politics-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          After so many years of warfare, Cambodia is now struggling against
          the odds to achieve real democracy. The difficulties are many: civil
          society is weak, corruption is all pervasive, the legal system is
          destroyed, and, above all, Cambodian civilisation does not favour
          pluralism and individual freedom, neither does it provide paradigms
          of sound and unselfish leadership. Intrigues, intimidation and even
          political assassina-tions are not uncommon, while some of the
          politicians, notably those affiliated with the CPP, seem to be
          inspired by the authoritarian style of Mahathir (Malaysia), Lee Quan
          Yew (Singapore), or Souharto (Indonesia), all of whom dismiss Human
          Rights as “Western” and, thus, unfit for Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there is freedom of expression, many politicians are not
          used to public criti-cism and react harshly. Journalists, for that
          matter, are not used to free speech either and many of their
          newspapers can only qualify as yellow press. The absence of any
          significant tradition in writing and reading does not make things
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          An additional problem is that the “co-governance” of Ranariddh
          (FUNCINPEC) and Hun Sen (CPP) is far from smooth. According to
          Sihanouk’s original idea, both these gentlemen are Prime Ministers,
          and all the important ministries have two co-Ministers, one from
          each party. However, instead of co-operating, the two parties seem
          to sabo-tage each other, while from time to time the conflicts
          become open. The army is divid-ed along party lines and skirmishes
          between the two groups have occurred. Be it as it may, however,
          Cambodia might already at this stage qualify as the most liberal and
          democratic country in the region of South East Asia (with the
          possible exception of the Philippines).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next elections are anticipated for 1998. Many scenaria have been
          projected as to what is going to happen. Much depends on the
          personal fate of the actors involved, namely Sihanouk, Ranariddh,
          Hun Sen, Chia Sim (CPP Chairman) and Sar Kheng (CPP emerging
          contender to Hun Sen’s position). However, if there is no change in
          the individual set-up, the chances are high that the two parties
          will be in coalition again. In Cambodia the only thing that matters
          is position and power; thus, if the coa-lition splits, the losers of
          the elections will have to relinquish power, the mere thought of
          which is a nightmare. It appears, therefore, that Cambodia, for yet
          some time to come, will not be ready to accommodate real opposition.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Personalities: Norodom Sihanouk</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/norodom-sihanouk-cambodia-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          <em>“Comme il est mignon cet petit!”</em> exclaimed the wife of the
          French Governor when she first met 19-year old Prince Norodom
          Sihanouk in the early 40:s. The French wanted a docile King for
          their Cambodian protectorate. They were not satisfied with an
          already pliant Sisowath Monivong, Sihanouk’s predecessor; they
          wanted somebody even more obedient, who would only care for the
          Royal Ballet and nothing else. They thought that this mignon boy
          with a high-pitched voice would be what they wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          How wrong they were! As we saw earlier, Sihanouk was the one to
          achieve the inde-pendence of Cambodia and, in many ways, this
          independence has been synonymous with his name ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sihanouk is the personification of charisma and a great political
          mind. <em>Samdech Euw,</em> as Cambodians call him, is indeed a very
          unique person and, because of his position, Cambodian culture allows
          (in fact, expects) him to be unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a playboy (he claims that since he won the heart of Queen
          Monique, he opted for monogamic life), Sihanouk is also a gourmet, a
          bon-vivant, a saxophonist, a com-poser, an author, an actor, a film
          director and many other things. A fascinating person-ality, he has
          the tremendous capacity to inspire confidence. Many World leaders
          who have met him have treated him not only as a statesman, but as a
          personal friend. It was thanks to such bonds of friendship that he
          has survived the one crisis after the other. For example, when the
          Khmeres Rouges kept him under house arrest from 1976 to 1979 (and
          killed six of his children), it was at the personal insistence of
          Tsou En Lai that Pol Pot spared his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sihanouk has definitely been modern Cambodia’s greatest asset, but
          also a liability: like so many leaders of his stature, he opted for
          personal rule and never wanted to cre-ate anything greater than
          himself. Thus, he never really tried to give Cambodia sound
          institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sihanouk is for Cambodia the equivalent of Olof Palme in Sweden, and
          much more. Cambodians adore him. The day he passes away, Cambodia
          will no longer be the same. Just like Sweden: it is no longer the
          same country since Olof Palme was assassi-nated.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Personalities: Saloth Sar (Pol Pot)</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/pol-pot-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          When the Khmers Rouges took Phnom Penh in 1975, nobody knew who was
          their leader. It was only after one and a half year that the name of
          the Prime Minister was disclosed: <em>Pol Pot.</em> Nobody had ever
          heard of him. However, when his picture was published, his own
          family were surprised to see that he was their own
          <em>Saloth Sar,</em> which is his real name. He had disappeared
          without trace many years ago, having gone to the jungle to join the
          guerrillas. When Phnom Penh was taken by the Khmeres Rouges, Pol Pot
          did not join his men in their triumphant parade into the capital.
          In-stead, he arrived secretly, several days later, when the city was
          almost completely evacuated...
        </p>
        <p>
          Very little is known about Pol Pot. He himself admitted that he was
          Saloth Sar only in 1979, after his fall, while on a trip to China.
          On the same occasion he also admitted the existence of the Cambodian
          Communist Party, until then held secret (the people only knew of a
          mysterious Revolutionary Organisation - <em>Angka Padevat </em> and
          of <em>Brother No. 1</em>). It seems, that during his years in
          power, Pol Pot eradicated all information about his personal life.
          His public appearances were extremely few and he never became the
          ob-ject of a personal cult, like other Communist leaders. Total
          secrecy appears to be the motto of his life. Those few, who have met
          him, say that he is a handsome and soft spoken man, polite, sensuous
          and convincing. He gives the impression that he does believe in his
          beliefs, which may be the very se-cret of his success (apart from
          secrecy itself). They all agree that this gentle person could not
          possibly commit such ferocious atrocities, like the genocide of some
          2 mil-lion people. And yet, there is no doubt that he did. All
          Cambodians, in unison, testify about his horrifying crimes, and
          people do not lie collectively!

        <h2 class="section-heading">A Case of Mental Cloning?</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/mental-cloning-cambodia-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          It is often said, that you cannot generalise when you talk about an
          entire nation. But in some cases it may be easier than in others. If
          one imagines the notion of <em>personality</em> as a circle, part of
          which is what we call the <em>“national character”</em> while the
          rest is a person’s individual traits; the border between these two
          parts is not the same in all cultures.
          <em>
            In Cambodia, national character is all-pervasive and leaves
            extremely little space for individual variation.</em>
          It is as if all Cambodians had identical
          <em>“software” </em> installed in their minds. How else can you
          explain that 10 million Cambodians unex-ceptionably consider plain
          white rice (without even salt) as the quintessence of all cui-sine ?
          If people were allowed to freely develop their own minds, this would
          be unnat-ural, for 10 million people could not possibly have exactly
          the same taste! <em>- Rizomania -</em> is only one example. The
          <em>Software</em> tells everybody what and how to eat , how to hold
          a knife when he peels the onions, how exactly to stretch his legs or
          his arms, what time to go to bed, what time to get up, what to like
          and what to dislike, when and how to get married, what exactly to
          say in a conversation, and many other things. Such natural
          differences among people as being introvert or extrovert, choleric
          or phlegmatic, early sleeper or early riser, are totally eliminated
          by the <em>software!</em> If you meet one Cambodian, you met them
          all! The only real variation is found in people’s looks (you still
          find long and short, fat and thin, beautiful and ugly
          Cambo-dians...), in their capacities (varying degrees of IQ etc.),
          and, to some extent, in their moral qualities (not in their values,
          though).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am inclined to think that the vehicle of this and any other
          mass-software is the lan-guage. Far from merely being a means of
          communication, language, embodies values, thinking, wisdom, and
          “tunes” the minds of the people with a number of “com-mands,” which
          are automatically activated whenever necessary. The Greeks, who
          rec-ognised this already in ancient times, went so far as to define
          their own identity not on the basis of origin, religion, geography,
          or political/administrative bonds, but on the basis of their
          language and its special characteristics as a vehicle of
          civilisation, a sort of human “software.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking these assumptions for granted, I would attempt to commit the
          politically incor-rect offence of formulating some generalisations
          about the Khmer psyche. I would then describe the Cambodians as very
          gentle and sensuous people, friendly, shy, po-lite, and
          accommodating. They would never raise their voice. Their answer to
          every-thing is a “yes” and a smile. Never opinionated. They are too
          eager not to loose face in public, and they consider anger as a
          synonymous to madness. Cambodians would ap-pear to most Westerners
          as genuine conformists, who are not interested in ideas or in
          challenging things but only concerned about their survival. They
          give the impression that they only care about the security that
          money offers and only cherish wealth and power. Other values of
          life, such as love, friendship, Justice, fairness, honour, or
          digni-ty, are very low rated and matter very little.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cambodian minds are tuned to stoically accept all the pressures of a
          strictly hierar-chical society: like in most developing countries,
          social stratification in the form of a pyramid is the most important
          social structure. If you are placed at the bottom of the pyramid,
          the Software tells you that you are nobody. You are not supposed to
          express your feelings or thoughts in public, let alone to ventilate
          your frustration: the Software offers you no legitimate outlet. But
          if you are on the top of the pyramid, you are con-sidered ipso facto
          as more handsome, more intelligent, and more capable than others,
          you have better rights than others, and you are even allowed to be a
          person and to ex-press your feelings, including your anger...
        </p>
        <p>
          This suffocatingly stereotype and collectivist Weltanschauung may be
          the very reason to the paradox, that Cambodia alone in all Indochina
          possesses such an impressive ar-ray of characters at the top of its
          society: those few who manage to withstand the enormous pressure of
          totalitarian collectivism must be gifted with extremely strong
          personalities. Alas, they are often so terribly strong that they
          place narcissist self-interest above anything else in the World.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another very typical 3rd World trait is the role of religion in
          Cambodia. You can never miss the omnipresent Buddhist monks:
          practically at any time, they and their pious followers organise
          never ending rituals, processions, festivals, and the like. The sad
          part of it is the “noise pollution” that they produce (the
          motorcycles of Greece are the only serious competitor!). Buddhist
          rituals could indeed be beautiful if it were not for all blaring
          loudspeakers tuned to the maximum volume and yelling on the most
          unpredictable occasions. In Islamic countries, by comparison, the
          loudspeakers are turned on at fixed hours, which render them a
          little more bearable...
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who believe that Buddhism is a philosophical religion,
          Cambodia could be a disappointment. Popular belief among Khmers is a
          mixture of ghost stories, supersti-tion and “magic”. One Judge told
          me, that in case I was attacked by a robber, I should recite a
          ritual phrase seven times, after which, as he insisted, the robber
          would run away. This approach to life seriously competes with
          rational thinking, which is slowly being introduced in Cambodia
          today. People turn to superstition and irrationality to find easy
          answers, instead of doing some thinking (and, why not, producing
          some ideas).
        </p>
        <p>
          To be sure, a nation does dot produce ideas just because its people
          are gifted. My own nation, the Greeks, have overwhelmed the World
          with ideas; and yet, I have never noticed any sign showing that the
          Greeks are more intelligent than others (albeit many of my
          compatriots keep trying hard to impress on foreigners, thus running
          the serious risk of being classified as arrogant idiots…). But ideas
          come from minds, and minds need to be free in order to flourish and
          release their forces. This can only be achieved in individualist
          societies. Collectivist societies, by smashing individual mind, are
          good in producing objects, but not ideas. Have you ever heard of a
          poem composed by a committee?
        </p>
        <p>
          Religion, or rather superstition, along with hierarchy and
          collectivism are in my opin-ion the three most important
          “command.coms” of the Cambodian Software, which is installed in the
          minds of everyone and defines all his functions in detail. Thus,
          like many other cultures in the World, especially in the 3rd World,
          Cambodian is a mass-culture with no room for individual personality.
          The paradigm is that of the flock of sheep, which are all the same,
          all white, and follow each other blindly. Black sheep are not
          tolerated in the flock and must be chased away.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of debate is going on these days on cloning. My experience of
          Cambodians is that their cultural indoctrination is so thorough,
          profound, and efficient, that they can be considered as (mentally)
          cloned for all practical purposes (unless it is a case of very
          advanced collective telepathy) ... I have until now met hundreds, if
          not thousands of Cambodians, and in 100% of the cases exactly the
          same conversation is repeated, per-fectly predictable each single
          time, including the mistake of always taking me for a Hungarian (see
          the reproduced dialogue below)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of individuality may be a typical 3rd World trait, but in
          Cambodia it is enor-mously aggravated by the astonishing fact that
          Cambodians never read books. Thus, their exposure to the World of
          ideas and choices is minimal. Instead, Cambodians are ruled by the
          rigid oral traditions of a rural society, which are embodied in the
          language and simply require everybody to conform and to comply
          rather than to think and to question. As long as Cambodia remains
          the place where there are hardly any bookshops (not even in the
          capital!) and where the sight of a man holding a book in his hands
          and reading it is unknown, mental cloning will be there for a long
          time to come and Cambodia will not be a society of ideas and quality
          of life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Nature of Khmer Culture</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/khmer-culture-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          As a corollary of the above, there is very little scope for privacy
          in Cambodian society. You notice people searching each other’s bags
          and pockets, and if you happen to talk to somebody in the street,
          several others approach to overhear the conversation (in a very
          indiscrete manner!). If you ask them to go away they fail to
          understand why, and they just stay on, which can be very irritating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The said lack of interest in the written speech is also a very
          disappointing trait of Khmer culture. There is very little
          literature in Khmer. Occasionally you will see somebody reading a
          newspaper, and then you will notice that he reads loudly, as all
          semi-illiterate people usually do. - Well, it is not easy to be very
          literate in Khmer an-yway: the script seems to have been
          intentionally designed in such a way, that only the elite could
          possibly master it. When you read a Khmer text you do not actually
          read, you decipher. Now, add the extra difficulty of joining all
          words together (no space in between), and you will get the
          picture... It would not surprise me, if a special-ist in linguistic
          psychology would suggest some connection between the erratic Khmer
          script and the equally erratic Khmer psyche.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, Khmer psyche is not always erratic. On some points it
          is very consistent, and one such point is its profound fixation to
          wealth and power. Khmer thinking is power- rather than
          justice-oriented. Equality of Law, for example, is a very low rated
          value, and it is considered as perfectly normal that “the bold and
          the beautiful” enjoy more rights than others, and that they can buy
          not only cars, houses, wives, or sex, but also justice with their
          money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where does the greatness of the Angkorian civilisation fit in? Well,
          Angkor was cer-tainly a great civilisation, but a Pharaohnic one. A
          civilisation based on the absolute power of the God-King over the
          anonymous masses. It was nothing like the ancient civilisations of
          Europe, which freed the individual. When Pythagoras visited Egypt
          and saw the pyramids, he wanted to know who had built them, but got
          no answer to his query: the Egyptians could not care less about who
          had created the pyramids. Some people made them, it doesn’t matter
          who, the credit goes to the Pharaoh any-way... The same applies to
          Angkor and its magnificent edifices.
        </p>
        <p>
          This heritage of Angkor haunts Cambodia still today. If Cambodia
          wishes to be a democratic society, with justice and equality of Law
          as its leading social values, and a society which produces ideas
          rather than objects, it needs reform. It needs to free the
          individual from all this suffocating imposition of stereotype
          behaviour, this rather un-natural uniformity of thinking, feeling
          and taste, so that also the enormous powers hidden in everyone can
          be released.
          <em>In other words, Cambodia needs to enter the 20th century, and to
            be exposed to the outside World, to new ideas and lifestyles.</em>
          History shows that no great civilisation can flourish and remain
          great unless it opens itself to such an exchange of ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Angkor is of any value, (apart from the aesthetic value of its
          monuments), it is ex-actly because it shows that the Khmers are
          capable of absorbing new ideas. In the same way as Angkor once
          merged Indian with indigenous Khmer ideas to produce such an array
          of magnificent masterpieces, Cambodia today could absorb modern
          thinking and combine it with whatever is worth preserving from her
          own tradition.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">
          Ancient Civilisations: Cambodia and Greece
        </h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/greece-cambodia-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          It is often assumed that ancient nations understand and feel
          sympathy for each other. In her eternal conflicts with Turkey,
          Greece finds that countries whose history is of the same length (if
          not of the same nature as well) as her Eastern neighbour tend to
          understand the Turkish viewpoint rather than the Greek. Younger
          European nations display a profound pride for all their achievements
          but fail to understand what is there to be proud of as a Greek or an
          Italian. On the other hand, the Chinese are known to consider
          everybody as a “barbarian,” but they do make an exception for
          Indians, Greeks, and Italians. Similarly, I have noticed a kind of
          “understanding” between former colonial powers. Thus, a Greek and an
          Englishman tend to speak the same lan-guage, while an Irish, for
          example, would stick to a more politically correct anti-colonialist
          parlance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If ancient history in itself is a similarity strong enough to create
          solidarity, on the other hand, the similarities do not extend much
          beyond this point. Both Greece and Cam-bodia have a long history,
          both countries have been splendid Empires and influenced other
          nations, and both have declined in the course of time. Also, both
          countries have been “eaten up” by their neighbours and reduced to
          minuscule chunks of land. But there are important differences. One
          of them is that Greek territory was lost due to Greek decay and
          weakness, while Cambodian territory was practically given away by
          rival branches of the royal family (or am I saying practically the
          same thing about both of them?).
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/temple-cambodia-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          More important are the differences regarding the nature of the two
          civilisations. Greek civilisation is clearly individualistic (this
          is of course the case of our idealised ancient Greek civilisation; I
          am not so sure that modern Greeks have inherited much of this
          ingredient).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Greek spirit is curious about the outside World (again:
          the Greeks of to-day have not inherited this trait. They even fail
          to display interest in what happens in the many and important Greek
          communities outside of Greece.) Until quite recently, the Greeks
          have promptly absorbed influences from all directions, including the
          ...much-despised East. The very word Europe, a Greek word, means a
          woman with wide-open and curious eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Khmer civilisation started open-mindedly and was initially
          based on an in-tensive processing of foreign influences, it soon
          ended up in isolationism. Today, Cambodians display a total lack of
          interest for the outside World. Even the relatively well-educated
          will confuse Brussels with Brazil and ...Brunei (sic) and, of course
          Sweden with Switzerland, not to mention their placing Australia and
          Canada next to each other in their mental map - if they know these
          places at all, that is, because Cam-bodians know even less about the
          World than Americans! Under these circumstances, acceptance of new
          ideas is an extremely slow and cumbersome process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Khmer civilisation, the Greek has always revolved around the
          written Word, which is another significant difference. Even during
          the 400 years of Turkish rule, when schools were suppressed and
          printing of books was a capital offence, tons of Greek literature of
          all kinds was produced in Florence, Venice, Vienna, and other
          cen-tres of exiled Greek communities. And today, at a time of
          continued political and economic decay and regional insecurity
          (which other Europeans usually fail to under-stand), Greece
          experiences an unprecedented glossoplasteia, i.e., a most prolific
          crea-tion of new words and expressions, while literature is also
          flourishing. In Cambodia, by contrast, the total lack of interest
          for writing books, and even keeping historical records, resulted in
          an unprecedented loss of memory:
          <em>unbelievable as it may sound, the Khmers had forgotten the very
            existence of Angkor Wat, until the French discovered it last
            century and made it famous!</em>
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/akropolis-cambodia-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          And then, Khmer civilisation, unlike the (ancient) Greek, does not
          pursue humanity and measure. In contrast to the perfect size of
          Acropolis (neither too big nor too small), Angkor Wat is an
          oversized Pyramid that seeks to intimidate the visitor with its
          sheer volume. Where Acropolis seeks to project something humane,
          Angkor Wat projects the mighty power of the God-King (preah) over
          all commoners. Naturally, there is no room for questioning of
          authority here.

          The Spices of an Expatriate’s Daily Life
        </h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/phnom-penh-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          An expatriate’s daily life in Cambodia can be a mixture of
          everything, ranging from uneventful monotony to rather exciting
          curiosities, and from comfortable pleasure to irritating nuisances,
          such as the constant electricity outages or the terrible noise
          pollu-tion. Generally speaking, life in Cambodia is not as exciting
          as in Africa, not as com-fortable as in Malaysia, and not as
          troublesome as in several other developing coun-tries, where you are
          constantly plagued by hordes of beggars, cheats, and street
          ven-dors. There are many nice places if you like to walk around (as
          I do) and street life can be enjoyable. Especially Phnom Penh could
          be described as an ideal city for taking a stroll. It reminds of a
          provincial French town and is almost intentionally made for spending
          your time in the streets, where you are relatively undisturbed.
          Apart from an occasional beggar or two (you gradually learn to avoid
          their strongholds) and the ped-icab drivers, who are constantly
          searching for customers, most other people are polite, shy, and
          decent. - But if someone decides to come forward with the usual “I
          want to say English with you,” then you got a whole flock around
          you, at once. Practically every passer-by will stop to overhear the
          conversation, and you will feel like a specta-cle. In Cambodia, a
          conversation can never be private, and it is always very
          predicta-ble. Never anything different or controversial.
        </p>

        <p>A typical sample could be like this:</p>
        <p>
          <em>- Accuse me, I won say Engli wi you (=Excuse me, I want to
            speak/practice English with you).</em>
        </p>
        <p>- Omilo mono Ellinika (=I only speak Greek).</p>
        <p>
          <em>- Accuse me, I can’ listen you (=Excuse me, I can’t understand
            you - “it sounds Greek to me” -).</em>
        </p>
        <p>- I don’t accuse you of anything. I am not a prosecutor!</p>
        <p>
          <em>- Nevermai. Wa i yo name? (=Never mind. What is your name?).</em>
        </p>
        <p>- Gerassimos Evangelou Fourlanos. What is your name?</p>
        <p>
          <em>- Yo name i Peakaday (=My name is Peakaday). Yo jo i wa (=What is
            your job?).</em>/p>
        </p>
        <p>- I am a Lawyer.</p>
        <p>
          <em>- Nevermai. How ow a you? (=“Nevermind.” How old are you?).</em>
        </p>
        <p>- I am 75 years old.</p>
        <p><em>- I very happy say you. How many chay you ha? (=I am very happy to talk to you. How many children do you
            have?).</em></p>
        <p>- I have no children.</p>
        <p><em>- No chay? No belie you. You lie! Whe i yo why? (=No children? I do not believe you. You must be lying!
            Where is your wife?).</em></p>
        <p>- I have no wife.</p>
        <p><em>- You slee only one any ny? Very boring! I can sen you beautifu why (=You sleep alone every night? Very
            boring! I can send you a beautiful wife).</em></p>
        <p>- I like to sleep alone. I do not want anybody else in my bed and I snore a lot.</p>
        <p><em>- In Kampuchea many beautifu ge. You lie taxi-ge? You sen one yo how (=In Cambodia there are many
            beautiful girls. Do you like call-girls? I will send one to your house).</em></p>
        <p>- No thank you, I am not interested.</p>
        <p><em>- Prakhae lok ponman? (=How much is your salary? - usually this question comes in Khmer, for no obvious
            reason...).</em></p>
        <p>- Bay roi dolla (=Three hundred dollars).</p>
        <p><em>- Oh, many money! (=Oh, a lot of money!) - Do you lie my country? (=Do you like my country?).</em></p>
        <p>- Yes, I do.</p>
        <p><em>- Oh, I am very happy! Whe i yo country? (=Where is your country?).</em></p>
        <p>- I am from Greece.</p>
        <p><em>- Hongrie? No know. (=Hungary? I do not know it).</em></p>
        <p>- It is called Prateh Krech in Khmer.</p>
        <p><em>- Nea Bulgarie? You know (=Is it near Bulgaria? I know it). You see Angko Wat? Kampuchea very nai ba Pol
            Pot ki anybody. Vietnamii no goo (=Have you seen Angkor Wat? Cambodia is very nice, but Pol Pot killed so
            many people. The Vietnamese are not good). I come yo how now (=I come to your house now).</em></p>
        <p>- I am busy now, another time.</p>
        <p><em>- Nevermai, I come, no problem fo me (=Nevermind, I’ll come anyway, it’s not a problem for me).</em></p>
        <p>- I am not going home now. I will continue my walk.</p>
        <p><em>- Can I wo wi you? (=can I walk with you?).</em></p>
        <p>- Not really, I am going to meet my friends.</p>
        <p><em>- You mee my fren? From Bulgarie? (=Will you meet your friends? Are they from Bulgaria?).</em></p>
        <p>- No, they are from Greenland.</p>
        <p><em>- Did you ea rye already? (=Did you eat rice already, which means: have you eaten already?)</em></p>
        <p>- I ate potatoes.</p>
        <p><em>- Do you lie rye? (=Do you like rice?)</em></p>
        <p>- Yes, but I cannot eat it every day, I need a change.</p>
        <p><em>- Where do you go?</em></p>
        <p>- I need to go to Monivong Street. Shall I turn left or right?</p>
        <p><em>- Yes.</em></p>
        <p>- What do you mean by “yes?” Is it left or right?</p>
        <p><em>- Yes, yes, OK.</em></p>

        <p>Apart from streets, markets are also pleasurable in Cambodia. Usually well-stocked and cheap, they offer the
          most amazing products and services. You can buy fried cockroaches, boiled eggs with a small bird inside, all
          kinds of electronics (usually fake), detergents, cosmetics and the like (all imported from Thailand, with the
          labels only in Thai, so that you can never know whether your purchase is a shampoo, a con-ditioner, or an
          after-shave), and clandestine copies of videotapes. Also, you can hire people to ventilate you with a fan, to
          carry your bags, to watch your car, and to pray for you...</p>
        <p>Many of the vendors in the markets are public servants, sometimes rather high-ranking, who leave their
          workplaces and go to the market to sell vegetables or fish, because their salaries are insufficient (a Judge
          earns USD 20.- per month). Thus, you can buy rice from the Judge, chairs from the Bank Manager, or oranges
          from the Di-rector of the Treasury!</p>
        <p>A golden rule when you visit a market is to just buy what you find in front of you. Do not ask questions (“is
          this a shampoo or a conditioner?”) because you will only get a number of irrational and contradictory answers,
          thus wasting your time and getting irritated. If you then show your irritation, they will “freeze” you, as if
          you just es-caped from a mental hospital.</p>

          Economy, Development
        </h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/cambodia-usd-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Cambodia is slowly developing since the fall of her Communist regimes and the intro-duction (I wish I could
          say, establishment) of an open society. But it has not really taken off. What holds development is the lack of
          infra-structure (it has been destroyed by the war), the lack of skills (Pol Pot cleared the country from all
          professionals and intellectuals...), the lack of Law (the country does not even have a Civil Code), the
          weaknesses of civil society, corruption, and the serious shortcomings of her institu-tions. The prevailing
          impediment, though, is lawlessness and the image of the country as a very dangerous place to be.
          Unfortunately, this image is much worse than reality. If you would give any European country the ingredients
          of Cambodian existence, namely poverty, lack of education, habits of warfare, weak institutions and
          leadership, corruption, and easy access to guns, you would certainly get a real hell. After all, the
          overwhelming majority of Cambodians are decent people (one of the bright sides of the Cambodian Software...).
          At least daily life is rather safe and workable.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the image of the country does a lot of harm and needs to be improved. One of the ways to change
          it is to convince the World that Cambodia has become a full-fledged civil society, by means of overhauling the
          legal system. Regrettably, nei-ther the Royal Government nor its donors seem to have realised this,
          notwithstanding their fashionable definitions of development.</p>


        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/riel-cambodia.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>Law here, as elsewhere in the World, is taken for granted and considered as a matter of routine rather than
          an important instrument of development and civilisation. Thus, many foreign organisations nag about the lack
          of Law Enforcement in Cambodia, but they forget that there is hardly any Law to enforce at the first place,
          and that it takes a lot of effort, expertise, and money to fill the gaps.</p>
        <p>Most observers agree that the country will inevitably follow the region in an economic boom and that it is
          only a question of time. But I am not sure that I would welcome the same kind of (exclusively material)
          development as in the rest of the region. I have nothing against an economic boom as such, but I do hope that
          Cambodia, above all, becomes free from the ghost of “tiermondialism” and conquers democracy, equality,
          justice, and quality of life.</p>


        <h2 class="section-heading">
          The Comparative Advantages
        </h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/cambodia-advantage-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Making Cambodia the only truly democratic country in the region would be the coun-try’s greatest asset. A
          place where investors, visitors and tourists would feel free to talk, free to meet anybody they like and free
          to send letters and faxes anywhere in the World. It is not so in most countries of the region: if you settle
          in Singapore, they will even monitor your shadow...</p>
        <p>In addition, Cambodia already enjoys a series of comparative advantages. The first is the country’s
          potentiality for tourism. It is perhaps the only country in the region worth visiting for her history and
          monuments, and not just for her red light districts. In the 60:s, before the war(s), Cambodia used to receive
          such numbers of tourists that even Thailand could not even dream of.</p>
        <p> Another advantage is the geographical position of the country, which is dominated by the Mekong River, a
          very important regional waterway, while the country itself links Thailand, Vietnam and Laos with each other
          and with the sea.</p>
        <p>The fertile soil of the central plains, coupled with the modest numbers of population (unlike most countries
          in South East Asia, Cambodia does not suffer from overpopula-tion) only add to this potentiality.</p>
        <p>Other comparative advantages are the regional availability of funds for private in-vestment, and the huge
          development funds pledged by donors. It is often said that no other country has ever received so many pledges
          by the international community.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/cambodia-walking-bg.jpg" alt="" />
                  
        <p>Finally, I would mention the civilisatory ambitions of Cambodians as a very important comparative advantage.
          Their pride over Angkor Wat and all that past greatness might induce them to try to achieve something
          significant again. As for the lack of books and a literary tradition, it could also be turned to an advantage,
          in the sense that it is easier to form a tabula rasa than an already shaped stone...</p>

        <p>When it comes to the lack of individualism, the Cambodian Software itself could remedy the problem, if some
          new “commands” are added to it, formulated so as to introduce new ideas and help freeing the minds of the
          people.</p>
        <p>There are indeed reasons for being optimistic; but there are also reasons for being pa-tient, for
          tiermondialism is extremely deeply rooted in Cambodia and does not go away very easily.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">
          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/cambodia-conclusion-bg.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>I can hardly think of anything else to say as a conclusion to these reflections of mine, but to refer to a
          touching inscription I saw in Phnom Penh, near the Mekong River bank: <em>“From this suffering a great
            happiness will come!”</em> </p>
        <p>Alas, this happiness may never come, unless Cambodians start writing and reading books, developing their
          individual personalities, reforming their feudalist values, and caring not only about money, but also love,
          friendship, knowledge, justice, honour, and so many other things that make life worth living.</p>
        <p>Last, but not least, I sincerely hope that none of those terribly strong personalities at the top of
          Cambodia, who exclusively engage in pursuing their self-interest, will stand in the way this time.</p>
