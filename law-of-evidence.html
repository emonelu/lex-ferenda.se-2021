            <p>
              English evidence law contains more detailed rules of proof than do
              other legal systems. This is largely attributable to the historic
              practice of trial by jury. Less strict rules of proof prevail in
              administrative agencies where juries are not used, as well as in
              trials before judges alone. The following are some of the detailed
              rules that must be addressed in a legal action.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/law-of-evidence-img/bg2.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Evidence and arguments are generally presented by counsels for the
              defendant (the person against whom an action is brought) and the
              plaintiff (the instigating party in a case) in such a manner, and
              under the rules governing judicial procedure, that a judge or jury
              may be convinced of its truth. The submission of evidence may be
              by witnesses or by documents; arguments usually concern the
              inferences that may properly be drawn from facts admitted or
              established. In an action at law, the person asserting a fact is
              said to have the burden of proof—that is, the burden of sustaining
              the fact until the trial is ended. Unless that person can present
              sufficient proof to overbalance that of the other party, so that
              it is more likely than not, he or she is not considered to have
              sustained the burden of proof, and the case is dismissed. - In
              criminal cases, all the facts relied upon to make up the offense
              must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt; it is
              often said that the prosecution must satisfy the jury so that they
              are sure of the facts. This even applies to most issues raised by
              the defense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain matters cannot be produced as proof in court, such as
              hearsay evidence—a witness's evidence of what somebody else said.
              Certain evidence should be considered with caution, unless there
              is other evidence—corroboration—to support it. This includes the
              evidence of children and people with mental disorders.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Burden of Proof</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/law-of-evidence-img/bg3.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The burden of producing evidence on a given point, and of
              persuading the judge or jury of its truth, is assigned by law to
              one side or the other in a court trial. Best known is the rigorous
              requirement that the prosecution in a criminal case must prove the
              defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Lesser burdens placed
              on other <em>litigants</em>(parties which take part in a court
              action) typically involve proving their case by a
              <em>balance of probabilities.</em>Thus, a person may be found not
              guilty of manslaughter for a death occurring in a car crash when
              guilt is not proved beyond reasonable doubt. That person can,
              however, still be held liable for damages in a civil action for
              the same death, and on the same evidence, because negligence can
              be shown by a balance of the probabilities.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Admissibility</h3>
            <p>
              Rules of admissibility determine which items of evidence judges or
              juries may be permitted to hear (or see or read). Generally, if
              evidence is relevant it is admissible. Nevertheless, certain facts
              that are logically relevant and of considerable evidential force
              are still not legally admissible because of their supposed
              tendency to “confuse and mislead the jury”.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Relevance</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/law-of-evidence-img/bg4.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Evidence is relevant when it has a tendency “in reason” to prove
              or disprove disputed facts. Thus, direct testimony of an
              eyewitness is relevant because it can show that an event occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using an article found at the scene of a crime to show that its
              owner was present is less reliable, because it could have been
              placed or dropped there by another person. Its force is weak when
              viewed alone, but coupled with other equally weak evidence it may
              suffice to prove a fact. Such
              <em>indirect or circumstantial</em> evidence can be effective in a
              court case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relevant circumstantial evidence may be excluded, however, when it
              could be misused. For example, a defendant's prior criminal record
              cannot be admitted. In a civil action, the fact that the defendant
              is insured is excluded because it diverts attention from the
              problem of legal fault to the improper question of ability to pay
              damages.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Hearsay</h3>
            <p>
              Hearsay evidence consists of statements made out of court by
              someone who is not present to testify under oath at a trial. Even
              if relevant, hearsay evidence is generally excluded unless some
              exception can be found. This rule is a distinctive characteristic
              of English law and is virtually unknown in other legal systems.
              One reason for the exclusion of hearsay is the practice of
              cross-examination of witnesses in open court by opposing lawyers;
              written or spoken assertions made by a person not present cannot
              be subjected to cross-examination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Various exceptions are made, however, to the exclusion of hearsay
              evidence. Not everything that a witness “heard said” is considered
              hearsay; sometimes the very speaking of words is important apart
              from their truth. For instance, the threat “your money or your
              life” proves an intent to rob. Moreover, not all hearsay is
              excluded from consideration. The fact that an accused person has
              confessed guilt may support a conviction despite denials or
              silence at a trial. A confession is an admission by a person to
              the action in question—a classic hearsay exception. A confession
              is not admissible, however, when obtained by threats or promises
              of favour.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recognized exceptions usually invoke either or both of two
              principles: the statement was made by a speaker who had reason to
              be truthful; and the speaker is now unavailable to testify. The
              classic example is a dying declaration that may prove the cause of
              death of a speaker who knew that death was imminent, because the
              deceased had little reason to lie and cannot now testify. Other
              exceptions to the hearsay rule involve written evidence such as
              birth and death records. Since the abandonment of jury trials in
              non-criminal cases, the hearsay rule has been relaxed in civil
              cases.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Witnesses etc.</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/law-of-evidence-img/bg5.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Nearly all persons with knowledge relevant to the case can
              testify; only those limited by extreme youth or mental incapacity
              are precluded. Witnesses may state only their own knowledge and
              are required to express facts rather than opinions. However, a
              special category of expert witnesses also exists. Experts do
              sometimes utilize hearsay and routinely express opinions. Doctors,
              for example, can testify as to the causes of death and injury;
              through training and experience, they are better qualified to form
              an opinion than the jurors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legal evidence is not limited to the sworn testimony of witnesses.
              Specific objects, when identified by spoken testimony, may often
              be introduced in evidence when their existence or appearance tends
              to prove or disprove an alleged fact.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Privileges</h3>
            <p>
              Except for the accused party, anyone can be compelled to be a
              witness in a trial, but not every question asked must be answered.
              Facts that need not be disclosed on demand are known as
              <em> privileged information.</em> Information may be privileged
              even when the response would serve the cause of truth and justice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only powerful social interests, however, can justify refusal to
              answer questions, so privileges are few. Among those established
              are the need of the nation to protect military and diplomatic
              secrets, often called Public Interest Immunity. A witness cannot
              generally be forced to answer a question that is
              self-incriminating.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, some disclosures made in confidence need not be
              revealed. Lawyers cannot repeat what their clients have told them
              privately. However, the spouse of the accused is competent to give
              evidence for the prosecution, and can generally be compelled to
              give evidence on behalf of the accused.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Corroboration</h3>
            <p>
              Independent, admissible, and credible evidence tending to confirm
              that the accused has committed the crime, called corroboration, is
              required in case of perjury, some sexual offences, and in criminal
              cases that involve the evidence of an accomplice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Western Europe generally follows a civil law tradition, and
              consequently employs quite different rules of evidence. The codes
              there are nearly silent on the subject of admissibility, most
              probably because trial by jury is unknown. Witnesses are
              questioned both by judges and by lawyers, thus minimizing disputes
              about which questions are permissible. European civil and criminal
              codes allow witnesses privileges similar to those found in the
              English legal tradition, although they are generally less
              protective of the accused party. The legal codes of Japan are
              heavily based on German laws, and still resemble them to some
              extent, but the post-World War II constitution also incorporated
              many protections of the accused found in English law.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Free Evidence</h3>
            <p>
              The civil-law systems have always left the task of finding the
              facts to a professional judge. This has a number of consequences.
              Above all, the rules of evidence can be flexible, since a
              professional judge is presumed capable of accurately assessing
              testimony. Indeed,
              <em
                >the law of evidence, so important in common-law countries, has
                no counterpart in the civil law, which follows the principle of
                free evidence instead.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The principle of free evidence means that the Judge is not bound
              by any legal rules when he assesses the veracity of alleged facts.
              However, the Judge must assess the evidence logically and
              impartially. Above all, the judge’s assessment must be based upon
              his sincere conviction, i.e., it must be the product of his
              conscience and not the product of any undue interference or
              influence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays there are common law influences in civil caw and the
              other way round. Thus, several civil law countries have introduced
              some Anglo-Saxon rules of evidence. For example, illegally
              obtained evidence can sometimes be inadmissible. - In Cambodia,
              the mandatory inadmissibility of confessions extracted by torture
              is such an Anglo-Saxon influence.
